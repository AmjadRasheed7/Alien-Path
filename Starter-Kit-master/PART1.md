## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Describe the problems encountered and provide the solutions / plan for the solutions.

### Board abnormality:
The board was generating random characters and not structured correctly, this is due to the user changing the default settings and using the old board that carries
the old values of rows and columns. This was fixed by creating a newBoard, reinitializing the map before displaying it.

### Error messages:
When the user enters a letter in a *cin >> int rows* or else. It prints infinite number of messages for a certain reason. However, it was fixed by simply ignoring the maximum values
*INT_MAX*.

### Alien movement changes the new Board structure:
When the alien moves, we repeatedly print a newer board. However, every alien movement caused the board abnormality, this is because when the user changes the default
settings. The display function still carries the old values every alien movement. This is was fixed by modifying the newBoard function. Basically the mapinit will run once to make sure
that it does not change the objects position every alien movement, and i put the display
function in a while loop until the user is done playing then we will probably add a break if statement.
